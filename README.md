# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine power, and more.

The application is built using:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Plotly (for visualization)

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Build a regression model to predict car prices
- Deploy the trained model using Streamlit
- Provide an interactive user interface for real-time predictions
